I developed a console-based Bank Management System using Python.
The system takes account holder name as input and assigns an initial balance.
Using a for loop, it allows multiple transactions such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking.
I implemented conditional statements to validate sufficient balance during withdrawal.
The balance variable updates dynamically after every transaction."
